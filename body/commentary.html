    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">I—On the Use of Sacramental Wine by the Savior</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> The wine used would not have been weak, lightly fermented wine. The condemnation of drunkenness in the Tanakh clearly emphasizes that an abundance of wine would cause drunkenness.<br/>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> Paul does not condemn sacramental use of wine. <button onclick="alert(fn[1-1].scriptures)"><sup>[1]</sup></button> He merely states the hypocrisy of drunkenness when in view of those who go hungry, not of strict regimented or consciously regulated use personally.

    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup>  Scientists presume the big bang theory as a plausible cause of the universe, this does not however account for any material necessary to accomplish such an event. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> Multiple gods are not created simultaneously in the same instant. They are similarly incapable of existing from existence itself. Thus in a polytheistic system not all gods are created equal. There are those who are inevitably created after others leading to those lesser gods being lesser in power and stature. There is no sense in worshiping what can be overcome. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[C]</sup> God being the first cause—or in other words the unmoved mover—is not a novel concept. Taught by many of the Church Fathers since antiquity, the most notable works concerning these ideas are contained within the Summa Theologiae by Thomas Aquinas. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[D]</sup> The first two sections were originally part of one continuous chapter. In the original Latin it was titled “unus aeternus deus.” § IV formed the basis for chapter 2 titled “ecclesia.” § VII formed the final original Latin chapter 3 titled “cor.”

    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—II</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> The saying, “Can God create a rock he can’t lift,” is a frivolous attempt to undermine the all powerful nature of God. It is asking God to do something that defies all logic, that which he will not do. God brings himself—in our mortality—to exist in logic and reason. This is similar to if God could create a square circle. <br>
	    &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> A sequence or plurality of gods is not plausible for the same reason as point a. God acts in logic, and thus will not create something matching or exceeding his power because to commit such an act is illogical.
        <br><br>
        Isaiah 43:10 ~ “Before God no other was formed, and there will be none after Him.”<br>
        Exodus 20:3 ~ “You shall have no other gods before Me.”

    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—III</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> Islam is listed to a lesser extent merely because the time periods of both Judaism and Christianity occur centuries before Islam. Islam was started ~600 B.C. which is six centuries removed from the life of Jesus in and around the Roman empire. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> Monotheism is not compatible with a monarchy of plural gods. Simply because you place one god on a pedestal does not insinuate that you believe those other gods are not gods. It is an internal contradiction to claim a monarchy of gods while also describing this as a monotheistic structure. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[C]</sup> “We were begotten by our Father in Heaven; the person of our Father in Heaven was begotten on a previous heavenly world by His Father; and again, He was begotten by a still more ancient Father, and so one, from one generation to generation.”  - Apostle Orson Pratt

    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—IV</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> This does not mean that the church could not err. Apostasy falls into the Donatist heresy claiming that all keys provided to the universal church were taken away from the Earth due to the sins and malpractices of humans. The church, however, can make mistakes and commit theological errors.
        <br><br>
        Matthew 16:18 ~ “The gates of hell will not overcome his church.”<br>
        John 16:3 ~ “Those who reject Christ do not know the Father.”<br>
        Acts 2:42 ~ “The early Church continued in the apostles’ teachings.”<br>
        Numbers 23:19 ~ “God does not lie or change His mind like a man.”<br>
        Titus 1:2 ~ “God is incapable of lying.”<br>
        Hebrews 6:18 ~ “It is impossible for God to lie.”
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—V</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> “The Holy Spirit has kept for Himself the task of encouraging, quickening, preserving, and increasing the unity of the Church.” - Wessel Gansfort, Life and Writings vol. 1, 138-39 <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> Wessel Gansfort was a practicing theologian during the 15th century. He is usually referred to as a Proto-protestant or church reformer predating the reformation by Martin Luther. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[C]</sup> Refer back to § IV on God's incapability to lie, and the failure of the apostasy in the church.
        <br><br>
        John 14:16–17 ~ “The Spirit of truth will be with you forever and dwell in you.”<br>
        Romans 8:14 ~ “Those led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.”<br>
        John 16:13 ~ “The Spirit of truth will guide you into all truth.”<br>
        Ephesians 1:13–14 ~ “The Holy Spirit as a guarantee of salvation.”
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—VI</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> The Great commission would have no purpose were it not for the fact that the church did not fall into apostasy, see § IV. There would be no reason to continue to grow in the church, or even institute the church given the imminent apostasy. 
        <br><br>
        Matthew 28:19–20 ~ “Make disciples of all nations; I am with you always.”<br>
        Hebrews 13:5 ~ “God will never leave you or forsake you.”<br>
        John 14:18 ~ “I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.”<br>
        1 Thessalonians 4:16–17 ~ “The Lord will return, and we will be with Him forever.”
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—VII</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> A warm-fuzzy feeling is sometimes taught by the Mormon church to mean a feeling of safety or happiness within the bosom. This is usually chosen to be interpreted as a type of the Holy Spirit. However it fails to account for the possibility that the Devil would act as an angel of light. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> Man, without the Grace of God, is incapable of returning to him. Therefore we understand the corruption and control that the Devil has over our hearts. 
        <br><br>
        Jeremiah 17:9 ~ “The heart is deceitful and desperately wicked.” <br>
        Matthew 15:8–9 ~ “Some who honor God have their hearts far from him.”<br>
        Proverbs 12:20 ~ “Deceit fills the hearts of the wicked.”<br>
        Mark 7:20–23 ~ “Evil thoughts and actions come from within the heart.”<br>
        Psalm 52:8 ~ “I trust in God’s unfailing love forever.”<br>
        Moroni 10:3–5 ~ “Ask God and the truth will be made known by the Holy Ghost.”<br>
        3 Nephi 11:32 ~ “Christ declares His doctrine: belief, repentance, and faith in Him.”<br>
        D&C 9:8–9 ~ “God will confirm the truth through a burning in the bosom.”<br>
        2 Corinthians 11:14 ~ “Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.”<br>
        2 Thessalonians 2:9–10 ~ “Wicked are deceived by lies because they reject truth.”<br>
        Proverbs 23:12 ~ “Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to knowledge.”<br>
        Proverbs 23:19 ~ “Be wise and guide your heart in the right way.”

    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—VIII</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> This section is not necessarily to be referenced in debating with the Mormons. The use of the First Vatican Council could lead to this argument being a so-called weak link. Its primary function is to form a cohesive link with § VII on the heart’s culpability.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—IX</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> Joseph Smith was partial to the Methodist sect of Christianity and found it the most compelling of the the options in Palmyra, New York. His mother and multiple of his siblings were practicing Presbyterians at the time of the translation of the Book of Mormon. Both of these Christian sects follow the trinity, and thus Joseph Smith would have been at least somewhat acquainted with this idea by his teenage years. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> Although several verses throughout the Book of Mormon affirm a trinity-like doctrine on God, several others seem to outwardly express a modalistic view of God. For more on this, see § XI. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[C]</sup> “...the Book of Mormon is the keystone of [our] testimony. Just as the arch crumbles if the keystone is removed, so does all the Church stand or fall with the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.”  - President Ezra T. Benson, The Book of Mormon - Keystone of Our Religion
        <br><br>
        Alma 11:44 ~ “The Father, Christ, and the Holy Ghost which is one Eternal God” <br>
        2 Nephi 31:21 ~ “There is one God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost”<br>
        Mosiah 15:1–4 ~ “And they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father.”<br>
        Mormon 7:7 ~ “The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who are one God.”

    <br><br>
    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—X</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> The Book of Mormon expressly denies the existence of multiple gods. Thus the other views like the head god theory are untenable. For an ontological breakdown of the errors of polytheism, see § I.
        <br><br>
        Alma 11:28 ~ “There is no more than one God.”<br>
        Alma 11:29 ~ “God is not a man of flesh and blood; He is eternal.”
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—XI</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> Modalism, also known as Oneness Christology, claims that God has expressed himself in different ways during different times and places. This heresy does not remove the divinity of Jesus, but blends the different persons into one being who merely expresses himself differently.
        <br><br>
        Mosiah 15:1-4 ~ “And the Son, thus becoming the father and the Son.” <br>
        Ether 3:14 ~ “I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son.” <br>
        Mosiah 16:15 ~ “Through Christ the Lord, who is the very Eternal Father.”
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—XII</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> “Hence it is impossible that God should be composed of matter and form” is a quote from the Summa Theologiae by Thomas Aquinas. This serves to back up the previous claims encompassing this section.
        <br><br>
        John 4:24 ~ “God is Spirit, and His worshipers must worship in spirit and truth.”<br>
        Deuteronomy 5:25 ~ “We die if we hear God’s voice, for who can hear God and live?”
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—XIII</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> Although not a commonly pronounced aspect of Mormon theology, Heavenly Mother is taught by them. She is most prevalent in the mention she receives in the Family a Proclamation to the World given by Gordon B. Hinckley in the 1985 October General Conference. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> The Father does not exist within the limits of a human form, because he would cease to be a spirit. For more on the idea of the incarnate nature of the Father see § XII.
        <br><br>
        John 3:29 ~ “The bride belongs to the bridegroom; Jesus is the bridegroom.” <br>
        Revelation 19:7 ~ “The Lamb’s wedding has come, and His bride is ready.”<br>
        Ephesians 5:25–27 ~ “Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for her.”<br>
        Revelation 21:2 ~ “New Jerusalem, came down like a bride prepared for her husband.”
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">§—XIV</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> Although Hell is assumed to be a place of eternal torment, we are unsure of the exact nature of Hell. Several artistic depictions show fire and brimstone, although it could be reasonably assumed that it is also a place of a lack of anything good. This would lend itself to the idea that God is good; thus a lack of his presence constitutes a lack of good. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> The Book of Mormon, in several locations, insists on the eternal torment and punishment of those who lived a life separately from God. The Mormon church today preaches of a three kingdom divide of Heaven where even those who did not believe in the church have a reasonable chance of procuring a slot in one of the lower tiers.
        <br><br>
        Matthew 8:12 ~ “Will be cast into outer darkness, with weeping and gnashing of teeth.”<br>
        Matthew 25:41 ~ “The wicked will be sent to eternal fire prepared for the devil.”<br>
        2 Thessalonians 1:9 ~ “They will suffer eternal separation from the Lord.”<br>
        2 Peter 2:4 ~ “God cast sinful angels into hell, holding them in chains for judgment.”<br>
        Revelation 14:11 ~ “The smoke of their torment rises forever; they have no rest.”<br>
        John 14:6 ~ “No one comes to the Father except through Him.”<br>
        John 3:16 ~ “God gave His Son so that whoever believes in Him will have eternal life.”<br>
        John 6:40 ~ “Believers in the Son, have eternal life and are raised on the last day.”<br>
        Acts 4:12 ~ “Salvation is found in no one else but Jesus.”<br>
        Romans 10:9 ~ “If you confess Jesus as Lord, you will be saved.”<br>
        Matthew 7:21 ~ “Not everyone who says ‘Lord’ will enter the kingdom.”<br>
        1 John 5:11–12 ~ “Eternal life is in the Son; whoever has the Son has life.”<br>
        John 10:9 ~ “Jesus is the door; anyone who enters through Him will be saved.”<br>
        John 8:24 ~ “Unless you believe that Jesus is who He says He is, you'll die in your sins.”<br>
        Colossians 1:19–20 ~ “God reconciled all things to Himself through Christ’s blood.”<br>
        2 Nephi 9:16–18 ~ “The wicked will suffer an everlasting judgment, cut off from God.”<br>
        Alma 40:13–14 ~ “The spirits of the wicked will be cast into darkness.”<br>
        Mormon 9:3–5 ~ “The wicked will tremble before God’s glory.”<br>

        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> Youth are the new arm of the church every generation. It is imperative that the beliefs you give them, you also found with logic and reason so that it is not easy to corrupt. A plurality of people who leave the church leave because of faith, not founded on logic or reason, that is tested by those who do have a foundation. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> The sections XV through XVIII were all originally contained within the second volume of the Summa. This second volume was cancelled and the completed sections were merged to create one full volume.

        1 Peter 3:15 ~ “Be ready to explain your hope in Christ with gentleness and respect.” <br>
        Jude 1:3 ~ “Contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.”<br>
        Deuteronomy 6:6–7 ~ “Teach God’s commandments diligently to your children.”<br>

    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> Prophets are that they prophecy. There is no value in the prophet who prophecies and nothing comes to pass. No one will hear them out. Be weary of the boy who cried wolf because he can still lead those not theologically sound away from truth. False prophets may, however, sometimes seem to prophecy correctly.
        <br><br>
        Deuteronomy 18:20 ~ “Anyone who falsely claims God’s word will be put to death.” <br>
        Deuteronomy 18:22 ~ “If a prophecy does not come true, it is not from God.”<br>
        Jeremiah 14:14 ~ “False prophets speak their own lies, not God’s words.”<br>
        Jeremiah 23:16 ~ “Do not listen to prophets who teach lies and deceive.”<br>
        Matthew 24:24 ~ “False prophets will perform signs to deceive the elect.”<br>

        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> The Temple Lot is not currently owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, commonly known as the Mormons. It is owned by a separate restorationist branch who are headquartered in Independence, Missouri. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> The failure of Joseph Smith’s prophecy seems to indicate that he is in fact a false teacher as it is laid out in § XVI.

    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> The message of the cross is not a message of death, but a symbol of life. There is no reason for it only symbolizing the death of Jesus, when it throughout the New Testament is used to show that he was able to overcome his death on the Cross of Calvary.
        <br><br>        
        Luke 23:41–56 ~ “Jesus died innocent, was buried, and rose on the third day.”<br>
