    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">I—On an Apostasy in the Bible</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> Amos 8:11-12. Do not remove this verse from its original historical context. The “famine of hearing the words of the LORD” refers to God withdrawing his prophetic word and guidance as part of his punishment. There was no church; only Israel who had disobeyed, not an apostasy of belief. Thus there is no apostasy—rather it serves as a warning to the disobedient Northern Kingdom. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> 2nd Thessalonians 2:3. God always preserves a remnant. <button onclick="alert(bibfn[1-1].scriptures)"><sup>[1]</sup></button>  In the original Greek a “falling away” or “apostasia” is not to be read as a loss of Word or faithful believers. This verse describes a future widespread corruption—or apostasy—but does not contribute to the complete and total destruction of the Church Christ established.

    <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">II—On the Validity of Additional Scripture</p>
    <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[A]</sup> Ezekiel 37:15-17. There are two sticks, one of Judah and one of Joseph. Those sticks being joined to each other are a metaphor for the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. Those southern and northern kingdoms respectively form a cohesive narrative with the containing chapter. There is no instance where the “stick” in Hebrew “עץ” represents any form of tablets or scripture. Thus there is no connection with future revealed scriptures. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<sup>[B]</sup> John 10:16. The Savior does not reference any civilizations unknown or places he himself would bring himself upon. Those “other sheep” are the gentiles. This is the fulfillment of the Book of Acts; <button onclick="alert(bibfn[2-1].scriptures)"><sup>[2]</sup></button> it also allows “one fold, one shepherd" to be the unity of the Jewish Christians and the Gentile Christians.
