            AN ACCOUNT OF THE LINE OF PROPHETS COMPILED BY IRKUT. THE LORD VISITS IRKUT AND EXTOLS HIM TO RECORD HIS HISTORY. KENSIL IS APPOINTED THE FIRST PROPHET. THE RECORD OF IRKUT IS AN ABRIDGMENT. THE LINE OF PROPHETS END WITH KEREK.

        <p class="text-left italic" style="font-size:16px;">
            &emsp;&emsp;The people of Chukoti have walked in wickedness—Irkut receives a vision from the LORD—he is to record the history of his people. The tribes are exuberant—they gather in abundance of material wealth.
        </p><br>
        <p class="text-left">
            <sup>1</sup> I, Irkut, do write these things: a few words concerning the prophecies of our prophets, and also the genealogy of my forefathers.<br><br><sup>2</sup> Now this history was hitherto unknown to our children who, being not raised following the faith of their fathers, have begun to walk in unbelief and wickedness.<br><br><sup>3</sup> Now I was born of my mother Yensei and my father Kakilithuit, who walked in the way of righteousness all his days. And my mother also was a woman of great faith and stature.<br><br><sup>4</sup> And it came to pass that, as I did lie awake beneath a larch tree, a visage of exceeding luster did fill mine eyes so that I perceived not the form thereof.<br><br><sup>5</sup> Now, as my vision did return to me, I was overcome by the LORD; and he spake, saying: “I would that thou shouldst record the stories of thy kin, that it might be preserved for thy seed.”<br><br><sup>6</sup> And I did begin to write according to the words which the LORD commanded, lest we shall be deprived of the love of our God.<br><br><sup>7</sup> Now I, Irkut, did obey the commandment of the LORD, even as I did write concerning the prophets of my seed, and concerning the prophecies which were given unto them.<br><br><sup>8</sup> And it came to pass that God did impart visions unto me, and also did he impart prophecies which had been lost, according to the records my people did keep.<br><br><sup>9</sup> Now after a multitude of people did walk in the way of righteousness, they grew in wealth, and did obtain jewels, gold, and fine raiment in exceeding abundance.<br><br><sup>10</sup> And it came to pass that, after they did obtain an abundance of wealth, they did mock the LORD, and did cry unto the people saying: “Wherefore have ye a God? Behold, is it not by our own hands that we have gathered this abundance?”<br><br><sup>11</sup> Forasmuch as the people did mock the LORD, the LORD did deem necessary to send forth a prophet to declare his word among them.<br><br><sup>12</sup> And it came to pass that as the people did mock the LORD, they did also blaspheme him insomuch that they did persecute those who did believe on His word.<br><br><sup>13</sup> Behold, the LORD hath prepared a way for them that believe; yea, He hath prepared the plan of salvation, that all might come unto Him.<br><br><sup>14</sup> Yea, inasmuch as ye love the LORD your God, ye shall inherit your place in heaven.<br><br><sup>15</sup> I, Irkut, write according to the words which the LORD spake concerning my people, notwithstanding the unbelief among the people thereof.<br><br><sup>16</sup> And I do write this unto the convincing of my people, and that they may inherit eternal life.

            &emsp;&emsp;The People of Chukoti are embezzled in wickedness—Kensil preaches of repentance. Do not worship men. Kensil is overcome with a vision from the LORD—Irkut abridges the vision of the Larch Grove. Kensil regains his strength—the LORD will punish those who do not believe.

            <sup>1</sup> Now after the Chukoti people did begin to inhabit the land surrounding the river Kali, the LORD did begin to work miracles among his people; and it came to pass that, as he did work miracles among them, he did raise up a prophet unto his people.<br><br><sup>2</sup> And it came to pass that Kensil, who was the prophet among them, did go forth among the people of Chukoti, and he began to preach of their wickedness, and to call them unto repentance.<br><br><sup>3</sup> And it came to pass that many among them did embrace his message, and they began to cry unto the LORD for mercy, and to pray for the forgiveness of their sins.<br><br><sup>4</sup> Now those who did not believe in the words of Kensil sought to destroy the church insomuch that they did gather in the midst of the city; and it came to pass that they began to mock the believers, and to spit at their feet; therefore they cried out saying: Forasmuch as ye heed his words, the spirits shall tarry to bless you—wherefore have ye reason to forsake your ancestors?<br><br><sup>5</sup> Now those who did believe were filled with the fear of the LORD which has not before been not known among the people of Chukoti; and it came to pass that they did worship the LORD, and praise his name.<br><br><sup>6</sup> And it came to pass that as they did sing praises to the LORD, they did also bow down before Kensil and did worship him.<br><br><sup>7</sup> But Kensil, seeing that they did err, did speak saying: Ye shall not worship man, for ye shall not reap a reward in heaven, therefore worship the LORD of Hosts insomuch that he should pass forth beyond the veil into the kingdom of the LORD your God.<br><br><sup>8</sup> And the people did cease in their worship, and did cry unto the LORD for forgiveness.<br><br><sup>9</sup> Now after Kensil left the centre of the village, he did go forth and did rest until the morrow; and it came to pass that as Kensil did sleep the LORD of Hosts imparted a vision upon him insomuch that he was struck dumb and fell limp.<br><br><sup>10</sup> And now I, Irkut, do not make a full record of the vision of the prophet; and I shall make an abridgment of the records thereof.<br><br><sup>11</sup> And it came to pass that I, Kensil, awoke, and beheld a grove of Larch which encompassed the whole of my vision; and it came to pass that I beheld an ant who did scurry forth beyond the grove of trees.<br><br><sup>12</sup> But behold, I did not follow, for I was filled with a great fear which did fill mine eyes.; and it came to pass that I beheld a fox who did scurry forth beyond the grove of trees.<br><br><sup>13</sup> But behold I remained within the grove insomuch that I was overcome with fear; and I was blinded from that which would lead me beyond the grove; and I began to walk circumspectly throughout the grove, but did not intend to go beyond the trees.<br><br><sup>14</sup> And now the LORD did show unto Kensil the world beyond the grove insomuch that the astonishment of Kensil was so great that he became dumb, that he could not move his body; yea, and he became like unto a corpse.<br><br><sup>15</sup> Now it came to pass that Kensil did wake; and it came to pass that the limbs of Kensil received their strength and were healed.<br><br><sup>16</sup> Now it came to pass that Kensil preached again unto the people of Chukoti; therefore he did cry out to them saying: Verily verily I say unto you, the LORD loves this people insomuch that he shall call forth blizzards, hailstorms, and all manner of afflictions upon you—lest you should repent and fall to your knees crying ‘LORD, LORD’.<br><br><sup>17</sup> But the people began to murmur, and to whisper; therefore they did not heed the words of Kensil.

        <p class="text-left italic" style="font-size:16px;">
            &emsp;&emsp;Kensil is afflicted with sickness—he becomes bedridden. Kensil curses the LORD; the LORD does not reveal himself—Kensil succumbs to his afflictions.
        </p><br>
        <p class="text-left">
            <sup>1</sup> Now it came to pass that Kensil waxed old, and began to be sorely afflicted with sickness.<br><br><sup>2</sup> And after the space of two years Kensil did murmur against the LORD, and did rebuke the LORD.<br><br><sup>3</sup> And it came to pass that Kensil became unable to rise from his bed insomuch that he did curse the LORD; therefore he did begin to wane in unbelief.<br><br><sup>4</sup> Now it came to pass that Kensil did plead for a sign that he should be certain of the LORD.<br><br><sup>5</sup> Nevertheless the LORD did not reveal himself unto Kensil such that Kensil did fall on his knees in anguish.<br><br><sup>6</sup> But behold, after the space of three years Kensil did succumb to his afflictions.

        <p class="text-left italic" style="font-size:16px;">
            &emsp;&emsp;Khor preaches to the people of Mitak. Mitak is afflicted with famine—the chief hoards a majority of food. The Chief opposed Khor and removed him from the land—the LORD commands Khor to preach to Hockta. Mitak and Hockta speak the same language. Hockta worships idols; there is turmoil in the land. Khor is asked to be chief. Khor disobeys the LORD and flees Hockta—Khor becomes sorely hungry.
        </p><br>
        <p class="text-left">
            <sup>1</sup> Now these which Khor began to preach unto the people that were in the land of Mitak, south of the river Kali.<br><br><sup>2</sup> Now it came to pass that Khor did preach concerning many things inasmuch as the people did listen; and he did preach concerning the LORD of Hosts.<br><br><sup>3</sup> Now in the fifth year of the reign of the chiefs in Mitak there began a great famine among the land; and the people in the land did go hungry.<br><br><sup>4</sup> And it came to pass that the LORD did harden the heart of the chief; and he was overcome with greed.<br><br><sup>5</sup> Now notwithstanding the sore affliction of the people, the chief did gather up rations beyond his need, and did hoard a great portion of that which could be grown.<br><br><sup>6</sup> And it came to pass that the chief did obtain immense riches which were hitherto unknown to the tribe of Mitak.<br><br><sup>7</sup> Now it came to pass that Khor was brought forth unto the chief, and did seek to relieve the people of hunger.<br><br><sup>8</sup> But behold, the heart of the chief was hard, and he did send forth wolves, and guards, and every manner of things to frighten Khor.<br><br><sup>9</sup> And it came to pass that the LORD spake unto Khor saying: Forasmuch as ye have been faithful unto me, ye shall tarry no longer whence you came; therefore ye shall go forth to preach among the people of Hockta.<br><br><sup>10</sup> Now the people of Mitak and Hockta did speak with one tongue, insomuch that Khor did understand.<br><br><sup>11</sup> And it came to pass that the LORD delivered Khor unto the tribe of Hockta; Yea even unto the leaders thereof.<br><br><sup>12</sup> Now the chiefs of the tribe of Hockta did worship idols, and did participate in all manner of sinful things.<br><br><sup>13</sup> This is what the prophet Khor said unto the chiefs of the tribe of Hockta: Behold, the day shall come where your riches shall dwindle, and your rivers dry up, and your beasts of the earth and sky shall run aground; Forasmuch as ye have forsaken you people, the LORD of Hosts shall forsake ye also.<br><br><sup>14</sup> Ye shall be cast out from among your people, ye shall fall before the feet of the meek, and the selfless forasmuch as ye have done.<br><br><sup>15</sup> And there shall one day be one glory of the sun, and one of the stars who shall look upon ye from the heavens above and shall cast judgment upon the whole of your people; Moreover ye shall be brought to your knees in great affliction of the mind and of the spirit—and ye shall know that the LORD of Hosts is your God.<br><br><sup>16</sup> Now it came to pass that the chiefs of Hockta did fall asunder, and did wrestle between themselves; Yea, insomuch that they did cry out: Behold, henceforth I shall rule over the people of Hockta; Verily those chiefs who claim ‘I am he who shall rule over you’ shall be brought down to their knees as the prophet has said.<br><br><sup>17</sup> Now it came to pass that there was great turmoil in the land of Hockta even unto the point of rebellion.<br><br><sup>18</sup> And it came to pass that Khor did place himself among that of the chiefs insomuch that the people of Hockta began to plead that Khor would become chief.<br><br><sup>19</sup> Now Khor did pray unto the LORD, and did ask for his guidance, and did plead with him for the sake of the people of Hockta; But behold, the LORD spake unto Khor saying: This people shall become one like the family’s herd returning to their father; verily thou shalt extend one horn inasmuch as they remain faithful.<br><br><sup>20</sup> But Khor did not heed the words of the LORD insomuch that he did flee the village of Hockta;<br><br><sup>21</sup> Nevertheless Khor did tarry whither he could escape the cries of the people; but he did seek to escape the wrath of the LORD of Hosts, yea even that he should hide his face from him.<br><br><sup>22</sup> But behold, neither can one leaf fall, nor one flake of snow touch the ground unless the LORD of Hosts has commanded it;<br><br><sup>23</sup> And it came to pass that the LORD of Hosts was not quick to anger, neither was he explicit in action, insomuch that as Khor did tarry forth in the land beyond Hockta and did find no berries, neither fowl of the air, nor beast of the ground in which he could feast.<br><br><sup>24</sup> And Khor, being a day's journey from the neighboring village of Litka did tarry for <sup>1</sup> month longer insomuch that he did hunger and thirst exceedingly.<br><br><sup>25</sup> Yea, the LORD was not quick to anger, and was not without mercy for his unbelief; and he did once again speak to Khor saying: Go forth unto Hockta, eat and be filled.<br><br><sup>26</sup> And Khor did as the LORD spake and went unto the village of Hockta.<br><br><sup>27</sup> In this the LORD was pleased.

            &emsp;&emsp;The LORD destroyed the cities of Salden and Patek—those who believe will be given mercy. Khor preaches in Hockta; he preaches of the destruction of Mitak. The Priests and Chieftains disbelieve—Khor weeps because of their unbelief. Khor sacrifices unto the LORD.
        </p><br>
        <p class="text-left">
            <sup>1</sup> And the LORD spake unto Khor, saying,<br><br><sup>2</sup> Every man shall take up his own bed, for the beginning of my work is at hand.<br><br><sup>3</sup> Behold, the city of Salden did I destroy because of their unbelief; and the city of Patek did tremble at the greatness of my power.<br><br><sup>4</sup> Forasmuch as ye have stretched out your hands, verily shall ye be given mercy in the last days;<br><br><sup>5</sup> For, I am, saith the LORD of Hosts.<br><br><sup>6</sup> I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy;<br><br><sup>7</sup> And those who have rejected me shall quake at my hands; but those who believe shall build up houses unto me, and they shall lie down in holy places, saith the LORD of Hosts.<br><br><sup>8</sup> Now it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the Chiefs, Khor went forth unto the priests and chieftains of Hockta.<br><br><sup>9</sup> And it came to pass that he did prophesy of many visions and of many things which he had seen; and he also prophesied concerning the destruction of Mitak, wherein the chief did rule.<br><br><sup>10</sup> Now the chieftains and the priests of the land did mock Khor; and they did cast him out, and they did stone him because of the words which he had spoken.<br><br><sup>11</sup> And Khor was exceedingly frightened insomuch that he did neither tarry in the land, nor did he attempt to convert the chieftains and priests.<br><br><sup>12</sup> And the LORD spake unto Khor, saying, raise up for me a standard so that my word shall be proclaimed in the tribe of Hockta; Yea they shall not perish save it be by my protection. And I shall protect those who put their faith in me—and I shall be a shepherd over my flock.<br><br><sup>13</sup> And the word of the LORD came again unto Khor, saying, great is the pit and narrow is the bridge into the heavens—Yea there will be many in the last days who shall be consumed into the pit thereof saith the LORD of Hosts.<br><br><sup>14</sup> Now Khor did weep, and he did mourn exceedingly for the wickedness of the people for he knew their day of judgment was soon at hand.<br><br><sup>15</sup> And Khor did make an altar unto the LORD, and did offer up sacrifices therein; And he praised the LORD, saying, thou art my strength, and my endurance forever.

            &emsp;&emsp;Quarruiiq and his brother travel in the wilderness—they kill a great beast for food. The brother questions the LORD for causing him to kill a mother. Human understanding is limited; God has endless knowledge. The LORD brings the brother to the mountain called Vetenvayena—which is being interpreted: place of great standing. The lineage of the brother would become vast unto the Earth—Nothing is impossible for the LORD.

        <p class="text-left">
            <sup>1</sup> Now Quarruiiq, being of a wealthy lineage, and having a brother who was to become chief among the tribe after the death of their father, went forth and sojourned in the wilderness.<br><br><sup>2</sup> And it came to pass, that he and his brother, standing before the death of their father, whose name was Kilak, went out to seek a land of promise for their seed.<br><br><sup>3</sup> And whilst the two brethren did pray, desiring such things as food and shelter along their journey unto an inheritance, behold, the first brother found a great beast; and after the ceremonial prayer was ended, he slew it.<br><br><sup>4</sup> And he took forth an ulu of excellent workmanship, which had been handed down from his forefathers, even from the ivory wampum belt, and he did begin to work through the hide of the beast.<br><br><sup>5</sup> Lo, the beast was used for meat upon the bone, and for raiment of the hide, and for all manner of tools; and the craftsmanship thereof was exceeding fine.<br><br><sup>6</sup> And it came to pass, that the brother did eat and drink and was exceeding glad that night.<br><br><sup>7</sup> And after the feast, he finished the skinning of the beast which he had slain, and rendered the proper honor and lamentation for it.<br><br><sup>8</sup> And throughout the night, there were heard sounds of distress, and the brother believed them to be from the forest beyond the southernmost river.<br><br><sup>9</sup> And he was led southward, and crossed the river, and came unto the place whence the noises proceeded.<br><br><sup>10</sup> But behold, his coming was in vain, for the creatures had perished—yea, they had frozen unto death.<br><br><sup>11</sup> And the brother, perceiving that the beast which he had slain was a mother, became wroth and cried unto God, saying, Why hast thou answered mine entreaty with such speed, and placed great meat in mine hands, yet led me unto evil, that I should slay a mother?<br><br><sup>12</sup> And a voice was heard from the heavens, saying, What thinkest thou? That I have led thee unto evil?<br><br><sup>13</sup> And the voice was with power and greatness, and the brother of Quarruiiq fell to the earth, yea, even prostrate.<br><br><sup>14</sup> And the voice said, “Thou didst desire a beast for meat and for hide, and thou hast slain it. But what knowest thou? For it was a mother.<br><br><sup>15</sup> I gave it unto thee through prayer, and now thou accusest Me of evil? Nay; the eyes of man are short-sighted, and he hath no understanding.<br><br><sup>16</sup> My eyes behold every flake of snow, every hair, every creature of consequence, and every mite which is of none. Behold, I err not.<br><br><sup>17</sup> Yea, but even the world doth cower beneath my command.<br><br><sup>18</sup> And in that very hour, the clouds did gather and poured forth an abundance of snow, insomuch that the brother could not see ten arms lengths before him.<br><br><sup>19</sup> And the LORD God commanded him that he should go westward on foot.<br><br><sup>20</sup> And it came to pass that the brother was preserved throughout the journey of many troubled weeks.<br><br><sup>21</sup> For the snow rose exceeding high upon the earth, insomuch that no man could pass through; yet the brother of Quarruiiq went on his way without hindrance.<br><br><sup>22</sup> And after twenty and seven weeks, and one fortnight besides, the brother came unto the mount called Vetenvayen.<br><br><sup>23</sup> And the brother fell into a deep vision.<br><br><sup>24</sup> And it came to pass, that the LORD of Hosts spake, saying, Behold, thy seed is great, for I shall cause thee to see it.<br><br><sup>25</sup> And in times past, thy forefathers were exceeding faithful; and I made it known unto them that their kingdoms upon the earth should be without number, even as the peaks of the mountains, or as the blades of grass upon the field.<br><br><sup>26</sup> And now I make it known unto every kindred, that I shall fulfil this promise: for thy lineage shall stretch unto the ends of the earth.<br><br><sup>27</sup> And thy people shall have exceeding righteousness before me, and shall not wander nor perish, save it be that the great LORD of Hosts be found a liar.
