            One Eternal God
        </p>
        <p class="italic m" style="font-weight: 300;">There is one true God. God is one. This was understood by the early church.</p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
            &emsp;&emsp;The world has one cause. The definition of this cause is God. If they <em>(the church)</em> do not agree on the definition of God what then is God? Is God one of many? If this is one’s understanding, how is God God? The universe was born from one cause which led to many. The first cause is God.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="italic m" style="font-weight: 300;">God is not a God out of many. Our God is the first God.</p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
            &emsp;&emsp;A man cannot have multiple gods. Many gods are created and created. <sup>[1]</sup> The first God would be the most powerful. This God is God. Ours is not the first God. He is alone. The most powerful god is not one of many gods. He is God.

            The Church
        </p>
        <p class="italic m" style="font-weight: 300;">The Church does not fall. If the Church falls all will be damned.</p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
            &emsp;&emsp;The Mormon doctrine of apostasy is evil. How does a church fall? According to the gospel of Matthew 16:18 <em>“the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>[2]</sup>  How can a man read this and not learn God created one church. <sup>[3]</sup> The gates of hell will not prevail against this Church. The Church is eternal. If the church falls; the gates of hell have prevailed in the church and their souls are damned.

            The Heart
        </p>
        <p class="italic m" style="font-weight: 300;">According to Jeremiah 17:9</p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
            &emsp;&emsp;<em>“The heart is treacherous above all things and incurable; who will know it?”</em> The heart is capable of lies. He must practice caution when receiving revelation. He mustn't trust all he feels. The Church Mormon says he must pray to know. According to Moroni 10:3 <em>“and ponder it in your hearts.”</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>[4]</sup> and Moroni 10:5 <em>“And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.”</em> Is this a contradiction? No. According to 2nd Corinthians 11:14 <em>“And no wonder, for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light;”</em> Can the Devil not give false revelation. The heart is not fully consumed by evil. A man can love God. <sup>[5]</sup> The heart is pure, but the devil will tamper. <sup>[6]</sup> This is not a contradiction, but a trap. The order of knowledge. Facts, Faith, and Revelation. The First Vatican Council in the constitution Dei Filius <sup>[7]</sup> spoke in this regard of a duplex “ordo cognitionis”, that of reason and that of faith, to which natural revelation and supernatural revelation corresponded respectively. All orders matter, but the order in which you trust is greater.

        <p><sup>[1]</sup>  Multiple gods are not created at once simultaneously nor can they all exist from existence itself. In polytheism not all gods are created equal, some being created long after others.</p>
        <p><sup>[2]</sup>  All verses cited are in Latin as published by the <a href="https://www.vatican.va/latin/latin_bible.html">Catholic Latin Vulgate</a>.</p>
        <p><sup>[3]</sup>  Catholicism, Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Assyrian church of the East all claim they represent the “one and only” true church. This is clearly disproved in Mark 9:38-40 and Luke 9:49-50. They prove the church is not strictly one organization but all the believers.</p>
        <p><sup>[4]</sup>  All verses from the Book of Mormon are translated directly from english into classical latin. All Latin is Classical not Ecclesiatical.</p>
