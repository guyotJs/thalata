        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
            &emsp;&emsp;No event in the universe can occur without a prior cause. Thus the universe began with a singular cause. This cause, existing preeminently, was by definition uncaused, but caused a repeating chain of causes. Thus the first cause is what we call God. If we do not agree on the definition of God, what then is God? Is God merely one out of many? If so, what constitutes our God being God? Whether one can make a case for a plurality of gods lies within a plurality of equally powerful first causes which is unthinkable. Thus our creator, God, remains the ultimate cause apart from all other intermediaries. <sup>[1]</sup>

        <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">II—As to the Succession of Godhood</p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
            &emsp;&emsp;If the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit co-exist as separate and distinct gods, but were not the singular God from all eternity, they are not equally powerful. If one god is stronger than another, why is the lesser considered a god?  There is no logic in a succession of gods, because the first god, who is the first causer, would be infinitely more powerful than any successor. The first God cannot create a rock he cannot lift; therefore the first God could not create a god to match or exceed his powers. For God acts in all logic and will follow the logic of nature he brought forth, and will do nothing to exceed that which is untenable. <sup>[2]</sup>

        <p class="m" style="font-weight: 500;">III—As to a Monarchical Monotheism</p>
        <p class="text-left" style="line-height: 1.5;">
            &emsp;&emsp;Monarchical Monotheism, or the Head-God Theory, is the idea that God, or the first God, has under him a council of gods, who are lesser than the Head-God. <sup>[3]</sup> Although this theology rectifies the theory of causation, <sup>[4]</sup> it similarly falls into polytheism. Every Abrahamic religion stemming from antiquity including that of Judaism, Christianity, and to a lesser extent Islam all agree on one, eternal, and unchanging God. The Book of Mormon, as it was written prior to D&C 121 and the King Follett Discourse, professes monotheism. <sup>[5]</sup> For it was said that there is One God, and other than him who shall I know? <sup>[6]</sup> This idea of “monarchical monotheism” is in and of itself an oxymoron claiming both the existence of only one god, mono, while implying a hierarchy of many gods. This belief is not echoed by the early Mormon leaders. Who wholeheartedly are more affirming of the infinite, or regressive, gods theory. <sup>[7]</sup> The Mormon church has never publicly taught the head-god theory, neither at Sacrament meetings nor through the Church Education System etc. It exists as a futile attempt to retroactively recreate Mormon theology.
