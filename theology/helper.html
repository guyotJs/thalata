            &emsp;&emsp;No event in the universe can occur without a prior cause. Thus the universe began with a singular cause. This cause, existing preeminently, was by definition uncaused, but caused a repeating chain of causes. Thus the first cause is what we call God. If we do not agree on the definition of God, what then is God? Is God merely one out of many? If so, what constitutes our God being God? Whether one can make a case for a plurality of gods lies within a plurality of equally powerful first causes which is unthinkable. Thus our creator, God, remains the ultimate cause apart from all other intermediaries. <sup>[1]</sup>
