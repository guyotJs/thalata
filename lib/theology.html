        <p class="note">And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. — Revelation 21:4</p>

        <p class="note">The first step to changing your theology is to first visualize the errors in your original theology. Step two is the much more complex step. We will argue for a Clavinist view of theology in contrast with others. This is not the only true Christian theology out there—don't limit yourself.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Theology</h3>
        <hr><br>
        <p>Calvinism, otherwise known as reformed theology was pioneered by John Calvin, John Knox, and Ulruich Zwingly. This theology section will argue for a Calvinist view of the Bible and of God. We do not claim to be an authority on reformed theology.</p>

        <h3>Information</h3>
        <hr><br>
        <p>This theology page is in <b>Early Alpha</b>. Not all links are functional and nothing is final as of late. There are no completed sections—not all theology will be acurate until further notice.</p>
