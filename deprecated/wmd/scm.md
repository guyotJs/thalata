# Summa Contra Mormonem

__The Summa Contra Mormonem is a collection of 18 points on the errors of Mormon Theology. It was originally composed of two volumes, but was merged into one. It was originally composed in Latin.__

## I—On the Definition of God and Causation

No event in the universe can occur without a prior cause. Thus the universe began with a singular cause. This cause, existing preeminently, was by definition uncaused, but caused a repeating chain of causes. Thus the first cause is what we call God. If we do not agree on the definition of God, what then is God? Is God merely one out of many? If so, what constitutes our God being God? Whether one can make a case for a plurality of gods lies within a plurality of equally powerful first causes which is unthinkable. Thus our creator, God, remains the ultimate cause apart from all other intermediaries. $1$

## II—As to the Succession of Godhood

If the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit co-exist as separate and distinct gods, but were not the singular God from all eternity, they are not equally powerful. If one god is stronger than another, why is the lesser considered a god? There is no logic in a succession of gods, because the first god, who is the first causer, would be infinitely more powerful than any successor. The first God cannot create a rock he cannot lift; therefore the first God could not create a god to match or exceed his powers. For God acts in all logic and will follow the logic of nature he brought forth, and will do nothing to exceed that which is untenable. $2$

## III—As to a Monarchical Monotheism

Monarchical Monotheism, or the Head-God Theory, is the idea that God, or the first God, has under him a council of gods, who are lesser than the Head-God. $3$ Although this theology rectifies the theory of causation, $4$ it similarly falls into polytheism. Every Abrahamic religion stemming from antiquity including that of Judaism, Christianity, and to a lesser extent Islam all agree on one, eternal, and unchanging God. The Book of Mormon, as it was written prior to D&C 121 and the King Follett Discourse, professes monotheism. $5$ For it was said that there is One God, and other than him who shall I know? $6$ This idea of “monarchical monotheism” is in and of itself an oxymoron claiming both the existence of only one god, mono, while implying a hierarchy of many gods. This belief is not echoed by the early Mormon leaders. Who wholeheartedly are more affirming of the infinite, or regressive, gods theory. $7$ The Mormon church has never publicly taught the head-god theory, neither at Sacrament meetings nor through the Church Education System etc. It exists as a futile attempt to retroactively recreate Mormon theology.

## IV—As to Apostasy in the Church

There is no right situation where one can believe that the church has fallen into damning error. Jesus did not design for us a church, so fallible, that the words and errors of man had the power to destroy it. The church has never lost its salvific power, and through Jesus received the keys of heaven and earth. The beacon of salvation will never die out. The gates of Hell have not, are not able to, and will not prevail against the church. $8$ The church is eternal, the gates of Hell have not prevailed, Jesus has not failed to preserve his church. God does not lie. $9$

## V—On the Permanence of the Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit has and will continue to build and guide the church. $10$ Did Jesus not say the Holy Spirit would live with and guide the believers for all eternity? $11$ The permanence of the Holy Spirit is a guiding principle such that there will always be those in the church who will be saved. At no point will there be none. $12$ The Holy Spirit has not failed, for could God lie? $13$ He will continue, neither contradicting Jesus’s words, nor preventing the spread of the faithful.

## VI—On the Great Commission

There will be a church that grows and lasts until the end. Christ did not tell his disciples that he would remain with them only until apostasy, but until he returned again. Christ commissioned all believers to go forth unto all nations and make disciples, but what use would this have been if an apostasy were truly imminent. $14$ Christ promised he would remain with them throughout all eternity; therefore an apostasy would have contradicted his words.

## VII—On the Corruption of the Heart

The heart is pure, wherefore shall the devil not target it? $15$ The heart is susceptible to manipulation; therefore man should practice caution upon receiving personal revelation. Test all things through the bible, make sure of all your thoughts because the heart will lie. There are those who claim that through prayer and the Holy Spirit one can attain knowledge and validity of the church by a warm-fuzzy feeling. $16$ They claim that the primary standing for belief should be that of personal revelation. This misguided focus allows for the devil to tamper with and trick us into believing we have received something from God, but instead have received it from him. $17$ The heart is fully consumed by evil, and unless the grace of God is poured out upon a man, only then can he love God. $18$ The heart is not pure; thus the devil will tamper with it. $19$ This error is neither contradiction, nor heresy, but the devil has laid out his trap in order to confuse the believers in the last days.

## VIII—On the Pillars of Knowledge

The order of knowledge: Facts, Faith, Revelation. At the First Vatican Council in 1850, in the constitution Dei Fiulius, spoke in regard to a duplex “ordo cognitonis”, that is of reason and that of faith, to which natural and supernatural revelation correspond respectively. Not all orders are equal. It is once again a misguided focus to place your belief simply in personal revelation, and not to value intellect, and the body of Christ throughout centuries, but to blindly believe in something that is subject to the devil’s whims. $20$

## IX—On the Trinity as a form of Godhead

The Book of Mormon, as it was written in the March of 1830, contains a doctrine of the Godhead which is alien from the modern theology of the church. Following the King Follett Discourse the church espoused the infinite gods theory, and later after that the head god theory from D&C 121. $21$ However, the Book of Mormon is a grand proponent of the doctrine of the trinity. This lines up correctly, due to the fact that his family did not know of the supposed first vision, and so were willingly visiting local Presbyterian and Methodist congregations. All such mainline protestants would have affirmed the trinity at that point in time. How then would such a misstep fall into the Book of Mormon if that was not its original intent? Why would these latter accretions of Godhead be included within newer scriptures if not to retroactively discredit the previous teaching of the Book of Mormon? $22$ As the acting pillar of the Mormon churches such a distinct contradiction in the Godhead would surely pose a valid reason to discredit the church. Take for account the innumerable verses that claim, Christ the Son, God the Father, and the Holy Spirit is one eternal God. $23$ Does this not clearly affirm the trinity? Three who are not one another, but are as one eternal God? One could claim that this may have only been an error in interpretation where most believed in the later theories, however even according to the accounts given by the three witnesses which lies before the main book in every copy of the Book of Mormon they affirm the triune God. “And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen.” $24$ This once again affirms the oneness of God while proving his trinitarian nature. Itself undeniably discrediting the later theories espoused by the church created in order to separate themselves from modern Christianity.

## X—On the Doctrine of Monotheism

Would the Book of Mormon, if it were to specifically accept a triune God not also assume monotheism? If this is true this would discredit every Godhead theory which were to speak of many gods. The Book of Mormon offers clear answers to this question found in discussion between Zeezrom and Amulek. Zeezrom clearly asks if there is more than one god? Amulek responds saying no. $25$ This directly denies the existence of a plurality of gods and so renders any other view of the Godhead unfeasible.

## XI—As to the Modalistic Heresy

An elementary view of the trinity would most definitely allow for the introduction of heresy in its definition. Modalism being a common early heresy which claims that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not distinct, but are merely modes of one God. This therefore would make the idea that the Father is the Son a modalistic view of the trinity. Joseph Smith, most scholars agree, had a limited—up to third grade— education. Would this not allow for unintentional slip ups in rhetoric or theology? Throughout the Book of Mormon many passages state that the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father. $26$ This is an error, this is modalism.

## XII—As to the Incarnate Nature of the Father

The Father possesses no physical form. $27$ It is physically impossible that the Father would have appeared to Joseph Smith. $28$ God is a spirit, and will not thus violate logic by appearing in the physical. “Hence it is impossible that God should be composed of matter and form.” $29$ Would the Son be able to manifest himself such that Joseph would have seen him, yes, however the Father as being a spirit would have not have incurred a physical nature to stand before Joseph. How then were we created in the image of God? Simply, we were born with a soul, logic, and the wisdom of the father. It stands to reason that we were created in the image of the father, not through our physicality, but through our conscience and spiritual nature.

## XIII—As to the Existence of a Heavenly Mother

Is God human? Is God man so that he must be wed? This is not so, for the father is a Spirit, neither of flesh nor blood, therefore how then could such a being truly exist within the confines of a gender? $30$ If not there should be no need for the existence of the Father’s wife. The Father is neither man nor woman, and for this reason he need not emulate such flawed human connections. For the Father shall never have been tied down to human limits; For in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth, and that which he created did not occur before him; therefore neither species nor gender will have ever predated that which is God. That connection that we propagate through marriage is not of itself a connection to the metaphysical forms of God. Marriage is symbolized through the relationship between Jesus and his church. $31$ Thus we do not make the assumption that God ontologically must be married, but we begin to draw the connection of marriage through that which Jesus Christ has become the bridegroom thereof.

## XIV—On the Existence of Hell

Has God been known to punish disbelief? Is it not true that Jesus himself has spoken more on Hell than of Heaven? Yes it is true. $32$ Jesus has said that there is salvation only through him, and the path to heaven cannot be reached by any other means. $33$ Truly even the Book of Mormon asserts the wicked will be punished according to their works. $34$ How then can one assert that those who lived a life of sin are able to procure a slot in a lower tier of Heaven. If man were to live irrevocably separated from God surely he would be damned. Verily it is said that you must repent and proclaim Christ is Lord and remove yourself from earthly ties and materials for verily I say unto you it is truly hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven, so drop all things and follow God in faith. $35$

## XV—On the Education of the Youth

A nation dies when there is no one to continue it. For thousands of years the process of catechesis has allowed all major world religions to prosper and grow. Children must be taught the beliefs of their fathers. Peter himself said that it is necessary to be able to defend your faith, and give reasons for the “hope you have within you”. $36$ Do not let your nation end, what a catastrophe that would ensue. It is clear that the reason one may choose to deconvert, or otherwise distance themselves from the church would be because of a poor catechesis. Teach your children, so that they may understand the beliefs you have instilled in them. $37$

## XVI—On the Failure of Prophecy

The value of any prophet shall rest in the validity of their prophecies. $38$ It has been taught for many centuries, let no prophet stand unless he prophecies truly. The teachers must watch their tongue for they are guiding the flock. $39$ They shall be held to a higher standard. Be weary for there are those who shall lead the sheep astray. There are wolves among your ranks in sheep's clothing. $40$ When a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if it does not come to pass, that was not of the Lord. Should a prophet err so greatly while still able to claim divine leadership? Can truth manifest itself in a bed of lies?

## XVII—As to the Temple Lot

It is known that the failure of a prophecy is the failure of a prophet. $41$ We are to judge those teachers in the strictest sense in order to protect the sanctity of the flock. Should Joseph Smith have been a valid seer all of his prophecies will have been fulfilled. Joseph Smith proclaimed a temple will be built on the temple lot within a generation. $42$ This generation, that of either 100 years or that of all those who were alive when the prophecy was spoken, has passed away. The lot is empty. All those avenues of which one can interpret the word generation have passed away. This truly is a failed prophecy. It is not that he said you shall build it, for that would be a command, it is said that it will be built. This is an error, this is not prophecy.

## XVIII—As to the Usage of the Cross

The cross is the most prevalent of Christian symbols. Why would one distance themselves from this symbol if not to also distance themselves from Christianity? They say that Jesus’ death is celebrated by adorning oneself with the cross, however, this fails to account for the reason such a cross is empty. They forget to remember what Jesus said to the man on the cross, that today you will be with me in paradise, and as he said this Jesus ascended into heaven, surrounded by angels ringing in the first fruits of the new Heaven and the new Earth. $43$ The cross is neither a symbol of his death, nor a symbol of pain, but rather an exemplary symbol for the true life, and resurrection of Christ. $44$
