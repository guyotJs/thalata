# On Nature

__This Short Theological Tractate systematically proves the theory of Predestination by the existance of a well aligned universe. Following the same theories as Haskell Curry to prove a identical set of inputs will produce an identical set of outputs given perfect equivelenance and ceteris paribus.__

## I—On Required Inputs

The primary inordinate clauses to assume a natural predestination are as follows: ceteris paribus $1$ or all else equals, and perfect equivelence. The first being ceteris paribus meaning all else equals which we understand to be a requirement of duplicable results. The second being that these scenarios, occuring within the same material situation, would necessarily produce the same result.

## II—On Atomical Similarity

The movement of a given atom is not defined by a choice the atom is making in any given circumstance, rather it moves in a quantifiable and predictable pattern that would be duplicated in a situation exacly identical. This atom, not moving of its own accord, is by its very nature constrained to move by how its surroundings and material composition perscribe. Although we percieve this idea of conciousness in humans, the given atoms and cells which build up the human person are not in their own distinctive conciouses acting. 

## III—On Replicable Movement

Thus these objects—be they atoms, cells, or molecules—move as a requirement of the time and place they exist. Therefore we see a harmony in nature of consecutive causes which continue repeating chains of causes. $2$ Even the animals move and evolve as a result of their environment; Thus we can assume that movement, actions, and foreordained elements occur as a result of the logical nature they are confined to.
