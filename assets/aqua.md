## I—On the Use of Sacramental Wine by the Savior

The wine used would not have been weak, lightly fermented wine. The condemnation of drunkenness in the Tanakh clearly emphasizes that an abundance of wine would cause drunkenness. Paul does not condemn sacramental use of wine. $1$ He merely states the hypocrisy of drunkenness when in view of those who go hungry, not of strict regimented or consciously regulated use personally.

## II—On the Ceremonial use of Wine by the Jews

Numbers 28:7. Wine shall be poured forth in offering to the Lord as a drink. Thus we, in moderation, can and are not prevented by any Mitzvot to engage in the consumption of wine. Jewish rituals did not involve excess drinking, rather they used it symbolically which Jesus continued forth into the sacrament. The drunkard is in folly, but that is his own making and not of the Alcohol. For everything that is done in moderation is greater than those acts so foolishly overindulged in.

## III—On the Duality of Sacramential Elements

The Sacraments consist of two inseparable parts. The sign, being the physical element, and the thing signified, being the spiritual element. They work together. Jesus sent forth the sacrament of wine as red to symbolize his blood. This is similarly why a case for other dark red juice can be made. They become both the sign of blood physically, while pointing directly to the spiritual connection of Jesus’ blood. A specified use of water would constitute a disconnect between the two primary elements of the sacrament. Water does not mortally symbolize the blood that it spiritually points to, and this fails to provide its purpose of a direct connection from the physical to spiritual realm.

## IV—On the Word of Wisdom

D&C 89 expressly stipulates that wine is to be used in the sacraments. This follows a condemnation that it is not good to indulge in such strong drinks. The verbatim statement stipulates, after a condemnation of the regular consumption of alcohol, “only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him.” $2$ This segment clearly regulated wine to a sacramental function as it was used during the early years of the church. The policy of water during the sacrament was only instituted in 1906 during the presidency of Joseph F. Smith. This segment is not up for misinterpretation due to the fact that sacraments before the Lord, as continuing from the Old Testament, consisted of wine used in worship. $3$

## V—On the Use of Other Sacramental Drinks

D&C 27:2, which allows for the use of other liquid substances for sacramental purposes, was only offered for situations of exigent circumstance. The revelation was only offered in correlation with the enemies of the church posing the wine. This specific revelation does allow for use of others, but it is only to be interpreted in context of a lack of drinkable wine. Therefore it is completely unfaithful to scripture to use water instead of wine. The modern LDS Church now uses wine as policy rather than exigent emergency, or lack of availability. D&C 88:5 remains the normative standard of sacramental liquid despite the exemption for exigent circumstances.
